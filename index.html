        <div class="NES">
            <p><a href="#">I first embarked onto the education system when I was 3 years old, joining BSK. My fondest memory of BSK was peeing my pants!
            I then continued to change schools and join my elder siblings in NES.
            Little did I know that the next 14 years spent in NES would entirely mould my disposition to a degree that was beyond my expectations.
            And so the journery started from reception and year after year time would pass so quick. So much so the past 14 years of my life have felt like just a single year.
            Covid 19 was one of the most recent historic events of all time; where the entire world was alerted with the situation being addressed as a pandemic.
            Due to the unforeseen cirumstances, school had shifted to online and life got alot more easier. Staying indoors 24/7 and gaming with your friends during school lessons.
            2 years like 2 weeks and school was back in person. Year 11 was the first year where results actually mattered. Alhamdulilah that year I locked in and passed with flying colors.
            The following year was quite the let down as I had formulated a whole plan to pursue a career in dentistry and the entire plan went to scrap after my As level results. 
            Year 13 was my last chance to alleviate my footing in a more prospectful future; and surely like all good stories have a solution, I just barely made into my first choice university.
            And just like that my time had NES had come to an end.

            <p><a href="#">
                I've been an avid fan of eating ever since being brought up. Cricket and football were my main two sports which I wanted to pursue to a relatively decent level.
                Every friday, family friends and I would go before jum3ah to play. One of those unfortunate fridays, I had fractured my wrist whilst being a goalkeeper. 
                The following year I had joined a football club and opted to be a goalkeeper there; and yet again... the exact spot was fractured.
                Dad had a sudden fear of my hand being permanently disabled; so football was a hobby put to its grave. I later than induldged in cricket lessons for around two years.
                It was quite humbling as there was a lot more to cricket than I ever knew. Shortly after studies had become a priority so cricket too was burried.
                Sixth form was the time to expand my horizons and build my character even more. So I applied for various roles and made sure to be included in school events.
                Social committee member, student tutor, prefect, docent at the TRDP museum, reader for primary kids, participating in quran competitions.
                Outside of school, I did some volunteering and rebuilt old homes. I did horse riding for 3 months which was a whole new experience.

            <p><a href="#">
                Sixth Form is what truly shaped my character and further sharpened my understanding of the true reality of life. My first year of sixth form was being a social butterfly.
                Engaging in conversation with everyone from lower and upper six. Where by my academic maturity wasn't even close to having a foundation built. I didn't take classes seriously.
                I didn't really take notes. I really just enjoyed myself way too much. Bear in mind year 12 was the first proper year of school in person after Covid; so I took advantage of that 
                and really enjoyed myself. I ended up getting BCC which was devasting. It had made me question everything. Most importantly it knocked me back into reality and made me realize my future was in my hands.
                If I wanted to excel, I'd have to take a step on my own and make sure to tie my camel properly this time. And so the stressful final year of school had started. I persevered and made sure to manage my studies properly.
                And after a tough year of what seemed like hell and 14 exams given, I managed to get ABB Alhamdulilah.
